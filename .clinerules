# Project Guidelines

## Core Guidelines

- Focus on solving the specific problem - avoid unnecessary complexity or scope creep.
- Use standard libraries and documented patterns first before creating custom solutions.
- Write clean, well-structured code with meaningful names and clear organization.
- Handle errors and edge cases properly to ensure code robustness.
- Include helpful comments for complex logic while keeping code self-documenting.

## Documentation Standards

- Maintain up-to-date documentation in README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- README.md should include project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
- ARCHITECTURE.md should document system design, component relationships, and data flow

## Testing Strategy

- Write comprehensive unit tests for individual functions and modules
- Implement integration tests to verify component interactions
- Ensure adequate test coverage for critical code paths
- Set up automated testing as part of the development workflow
